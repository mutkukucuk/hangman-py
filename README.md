# Hangman Game in Python

## Overview
This project is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Hangman game. The player attempts to guess the letters of a randomly chosen word within a limited number of attempts. The game features word selection, life tracking, and a graphical representation of the hangman as the player progresses.

## Features
- Random word selection from a predefined list
- Life counter with a maximum of 6 attempts
- Visual hangman stages
- Simple command-line interface
- Detection of repeated guesses

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `hangman.py` file in a Python environment.
3. The program will randomly choose a word.
4. You need to guess the letters one by one. Each incorrect guess decreases your lives by 1.
5. You win if you guess all the letters correctly before running out of lives.
6. If your lives reach 0, the game ends, and you lose.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd hangman
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python hangman.py
   ```
